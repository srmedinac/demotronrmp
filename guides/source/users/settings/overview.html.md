# Overview

Solidus's **Settings** section includes a number of pages that help you manage
store-wide settings, including tax rates, shipping methods, and payment methods.

This article introduces each settings page and how the settings affect your
store. 

## Zones

Before you set up your shipping and tax settings, you should start by setting up
zones. A zone is a group of states or countries that your store needs to ship to
and/or tax. A country or state could exist in multiple zones or none at all.

For more information on how to use zones, see the [Zones][zones] article.

## Taxes

With Solidus, you can create tax rates and tax categories that correspond with
each item in your store and each location that you ship to.
